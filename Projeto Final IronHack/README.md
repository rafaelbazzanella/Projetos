## Final Project - Products TimeSeries Analysis


## Objective
* This project started by understanding the tables in a database
* Went through the analysis of the relationship between customer and maintenance to try to predict if there is a customer return relationship in case of problems
* And finally a temporal analysis of the product aiming to know which asset to invest and which time of the year is better

Some points of improvement were identified as lack of standardization in primary keys. Other points of improvement were noted as a suggestion to add some keys in some tables to allow new analyzes
